## Game Overview

VR is You is a puzzle game where rules in the world are dictated by physical cubes that can found within each puzzle. Rules are created through "sentences", or rather groups of three words: an *object*, the word *is*, and an object *property*. All you need to win the game is to reach an object with the *win* property. Use L and R triggers to grab objects.
